"""
Modules package - Business logic and utilities.

This package contains all business logic, data processing, and utility functions
that are independent of the HTTP layer. Modules should focus on:
- Data manipulation
- Business rules
- Algorithms
- Utilities
- Domain logic

HTTP-related code should be in src.pages instead.
